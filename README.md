# lapy
License header Adder in Python.

This project is currently being worked on as of 1/2/2020.

The plan is to have lapy be able to add a license to certain files for programming.

My current goal is to have the current class that I'm working on, nhapy, to add licenses through a linear way.

Goals for the nhapy class:
1. Be able to track what files it has been to.
1. Be able to track what directories it has been to.
1. Add license headers when there are none.
1. Update license headers when there are similar license headers.
1. Remove and replace license headers.

Goals after nhapy object is complete:
1. Handle all possible errors that could happen within nhapy.
1. Make unit tests for all parts of the nhapy.
1. Add a class that mimics nhapy, but using multiple threads.
1. Hanlde all possible errors that could happen within the mimic class.
1. make unit tests for all parts of the mimic class.
